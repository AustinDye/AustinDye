### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Austin Dye
Male || He/Him || INTP-T

Interested in: QA Test Automation || Machine Learning || Virtual Reality / Augemented Reality Technology || Video Game Development

I am currently learning to code at a coding bootcamp known as BoiseCodeworks (https://boisecodeworks.com) in Boise, Idaho. 
I have a small background in software QA, IT, and sales. I've wanted to become a programmer since I was young 
and I hope to impress with what I'm able to create as I learn this incredibly interesting and rewarding skill.
