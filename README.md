### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Austin Dye


I am currently learning to code at a coding bootcamp known as BoiseCodeworks in Boise, Idaho. 
I have a small background in software QA, IT, and sales. I'v wanted to become a programmer since 
I was young and I hope to impress with what I'm able to create as I learn this incredibly interesting and rewarding skill.
